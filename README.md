# Project Good Practices

## Modular Structure

### Relevant Code
- ArticlesModule in articles.module.ts

## Use of DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

### Relevant Code
- ArticleDto, CreateArticleDto, UpdateArticleDto in article.dto.ts

## Dependency Injection

### Relevant Code
- Throughout the ArticlesService and other services where dependencies are injected.

## Middleware Usage

### Relevant Code
- Not explicitly shown in the provided code. Middleware would typically be implemented in a separate middleware file or within NestJS interceptors.

## Error Handling Middleware

### Relevant Code
- Not explicitly shown. Error handling middleware would be implemented separately.

## Validation Pipes

### Relevant Code
- Validation is handled in the ArticlesController using DTOs.

## Code Quality Refactoring

### Consistent Naming

#### Relevant Code
- Throughout the entire codebase.

### Code Duplication

#### Relevant Code
- Not explicitly shown. It would be identified and addressed in various parts of the codebase.

### Enhanced Logging

#### Relevant Code
- Logging improvements would be implemented throughout critical areas in the services.

### Unit Tests

#### Relevant Code
- ArticlesService unit tests in articles.service.spec.ts.

### Use of Interfaces

#### Relevant Code
- Interfaces are used for Article and MutableArticle.

## CI/CD Improvement

### Automated Testing

#### Relevant Code
- Integration of automated tests is suggested but not explicitly shown.

### Static Code Analysis

#### Relevant Code
- Not explicitly shown. This would involve tools like ESLint or TSLint.

### Code Reviews

#### Relevant Code
- Emphasized as a practice but not explicitly shown in the code.

### Continuous Monitoring

#### Relevant Code
- Not explicitly shown. This involves tools for monitoring in the production environment.

## Developer Experience (DevX) Enhancement

### Documentation

#### Relevant Code
- Documentation improvements would be applied throughout the codebase.

### Automated Setup

#### Relevant Code
- Automated setup scripts are suggested but not explicitly shown.

### Live Reload

#### Relevant Code
- Live reload configurations would be implemented but not explicitly shown.

### Swagger/OpenAPI

#### Relevant Code
- Swagger/OpenAPI integration is suggested but not shown.

## Security Improvements

### Input Validation

#### Relevant Code
- Handled through validation pipes in ArticlesController.

### Authentication and Authorization

#### Relevant Code
- Authentication handled in JwtStrategy and AuthService.

### Dependency Scanning

#### Relevant Code
- Dependency scanning is suggested but not explicitly shown.

### Data Encryption

#### Relevant Code
- Not explicitly shown. Would involve encrypting sensitive data.

## Adding a Commenting Feature

### Relevant Code
- The code for adding a commenting feature is not provided, but suggestions are given for database schema, API endpoints, DTOs, authentication, validation, notifications, testing, and documentation.
